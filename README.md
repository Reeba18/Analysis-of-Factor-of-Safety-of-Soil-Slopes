## Introduction

Slope is an unsupported inclined mass of soil or rock.Natural slopes are those formed by natural causes and they include hills and valley slopes.
Artificial slopes are the ones engineered by humans and include earthen dams,highway and railway embankments,landfills,levees etc.
Failure of a soil mass takes place by the downward and outward movement of soil which is caused by the action of gravitational forces, supplemented by earthquake forces in some cases. 
The factor of safety (FOS)  is defined as the ratio of the sum of resisting forces or moments to the sum of driving forces or moments. When the factor of safety is equal to 1.0 a slope has just reached critical failure condition. If the factor of safety falls below 1.0 then a failure is imminent  or has already occurred. Factors of safety in the range of 1.3 to 1.5 are considered reasonably safe in many design scenarios.

## Data

Soil slopes of heights (h) 3m,6m,9m and 12m are taken into consideration.
Different slope angles of 2H:1V,1.5H:1V,1H:1V and 0.5H:1V are provided for each height.
Soils of various strength parameters are to be analysed.
The data used is firat-hand and is generated using a Civil Engineering software named PLAXIS-2D.


## Objective

Analysis of Factors of Safety at different slope heights, slope angles and strength parameters of soil such as cohesion and angle of internal friction.
This in turn helps geotechnical engineers gain deeper understanding of the stability of existing slopes, assess the possibility of landslides in natural 
and engineered slopes, enable redesign of failed slopes and planning of prevententive measures and study the effect of seismic loading on embankments and slopes.

## Tools

The data is analysed using Excel and visualizations are created using Tableau. Please use the following link to access it:

## Results

It can be noted that under no surcharge (loading) conditions with other parameters remaining unaltered,

1.	Factor of safety increases with increase in cohesion value
2.	Factor of safety increases with increase in the value of friction angle and
3.	Factor of safety decreases as the slope angle increases
4. Factor of safety decreases as the slope is of a greater height
